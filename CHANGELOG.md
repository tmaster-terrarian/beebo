# v2.1a

added this changelog!

implemented more usage of delta timing, in preparation of real slow-motion mechanics

gameplay change: the player now slows down to their max speed over time while on the ground and holding a movement key
> before this change the player would keep their speed making bomb boosting extremely broken<br>
> this change does not apply while in the air

fixed a visual bug when the player falls in a pit while at high speeds.<br>
fixed a very old visual bug where pixel particles were the wrong color when in fullscreen.

added object: `fx_bossintro`

added language key: `ui.warning`

# v2.1b

new formatting for `CHANGELOG.md`. hopefully this one stays!

removed unused files in the `datafiles` directory.<br>
level data has been moved from `leveldata` to `data/levels`

translations are now data-driven! you can find them in `data/lang.json`
