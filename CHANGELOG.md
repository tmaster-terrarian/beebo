### 2.1a

technical change: implemented more usage of delta timing, in preparation of real slow-motion mechanics

gameplay change: the player now slows down to their max speed over time while on the ground and holding a movement key
    before the player would keep their speed making bomb boosting extremely broken
    this does not apply while in the air

fixed a visual bug when the player falls in a pit while at high speeds
fixed a very old visual bug where pixel particles were the wrong color when in fullscreen

added object: fx_bossintro

added language key: ui.warning
