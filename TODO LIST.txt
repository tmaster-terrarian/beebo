Rough n' Tumbler
item that makes you do more damage the faster youre going
"the faster you move the harder you hit"
increase damage by 20% (+10% per stack) of additional movement speed

item that has a chance to repair consumed items on stage start

stages
[x] random level generation using the templates model
    [x] invent gamemaker prefabs (yippee!!!!!! so FUN!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA)
    [/] level metadata
        enemy whitelist
        level name, type, etc.
    [/] tilemap stuff
        [x] auto tiling with 8-bit mask
        [x] randomness for variety

item system
[x] rework to use ids (similarish to minecraft's approach), instead of direct references to the defs (hard to manage, hard to make dynamic)
    format:
    {
        id : string,
        stacks : number
    }
    example:
    obj_player.items =
    [
        {
            id : "amorphous_plush",
            stacks : 2
        },
        {
            id : "eviction_notice",
            stacks : 1
        },
        {
            id : "serrated_stinger",
            stacks : 2
        }
    ]
    for item effects, loop through array and run the function relating to the item's id
    to check for a specific item, loop through array and check if the item's id matches the selector, otherwise use fallback value
